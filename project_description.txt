Project Title: Wine Quality Prediction

Description:
This project aims to predict the quality of wines based on various features, such as acidity, sulfur dioxide levels, and alcohol content. We utilize a dataset containing wine samples with associated quality ratings. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify wines into 'low,' 'medium,' or 'high' quality categories.

Additionally, we will assess the accuracy of our wine quality predictions. Accuracy is a key performance metric that indicates the model's ability to correctly classify wines into their respective quality categories. It will help us evaluate the effectiveness of the model in practical use.

Data Source:
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/code/oykuer/wine-quality-prediction-0-92?scriptVersionId=104401122&cellId=7].

Methodology:
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, outlier removal, and one-hot encoding.
- Model: Utilizing a Random Forest Classifier for quality prediction.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Employing RandomizedSearchCV to find optimal model parameters.

Libraries and Tools:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
